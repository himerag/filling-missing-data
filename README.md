# filling-missing-data
In this project, a method is proposed to fill in missing data from satellite images using data-intensive computing platforms. The proposed method merges satellite imagery from diverse sources to reduce the impact of the holes that result from capture conditions: occlusion, the satellite trajectory, sunlight, among others. The proposed approach is compared to \emph{state of the art} approaches, including the average of pixels and the use of empirical orthogonal functions to estimate missing samples. The computational complexity derived from the use of large high-resolution images is addressed by intensive computing techniques that assume an underlying cluster architecture. For proof of concept, the method was implemented to study the concentration of chlorophyll at the Mexican oceans by merging data from VIIRS and MODIS sensors. A visual comparison of the results reveal that the proposed approach provides a more accurate estimation of chlorophyll level compared to the mean of pixels method.
